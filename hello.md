Welcome to my sandbox where I break things for fun and occasionally make something cool. This is where code meets creativity â€” a space for wild experiments, generative art, visual algorithms, and other hacky goodness.  <br><br>

Check out my sketches ðŸš€ <br><br>

- [Three.js](./sketch/three): My first experiment with three.js. Press and hold to orbit. <br><br>
- [Perlin Noise](./sketch/perlin-noise/): A Perlin Noise Walker in P5.js <br><br>
- [Hydra Painter](./sketch/hydra-painter): p5.js sketch that uses Hydra as a brush texture for drawing when the mouse is pressed.  <br><br>
- [Easing Vectors](./sketch/easing-vectors): p5.js sketch that defines a Mover class that uses vectors for position, velocity, and acceleration to simulate spring-damped bouncing circles between two vertical limits.  <br><br>
- [Hydra 01](./sketch/hydra-01): My first experiment with Hydra and P5. <br><br>
