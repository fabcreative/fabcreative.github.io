Welcome to my sandbox where I break things for fun and occasionally make something cool. A space for experiments, generative art, visual algorithms, and other hacky goodness.  <br><br>

Check out my sketches ðŸš€ <br><br>

- [Three.js](./sketch/three): My first experiment with three.js. Press and hold to orbit. <br><br>
- [Perlin Noise Walker](./sketch/perlin-noise/): The nature of code chapter 0. Randomness. <br><br>
- [Hydra Painter](./sketch/hydra-painter): Sketch in P5 that uses Hydra as a brush texture for drawing.  <br><br>
- [Easing Vectors](./sketch/easing-vectors): The nature of code chapter 1. Vectors. A sketch in P5 that defines a Mover class that uses vectors for position, velocity, and acceleration to simulate spring-damped bouncing circles between two vertical limits.  <br><br>
- [Hydra 01](./sketch/hydra-01): My first experiment with Hydra and P5. <br><br>
