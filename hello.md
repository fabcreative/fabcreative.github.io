# console.log('Hello world!');

Welcome to my sandbox where I break things for fun and occasionally make something cool. This is where raw code meets creativity â€” a space for wild experiments, generative art, visual algorithms, and other hacky goodness. Expect scribbles in p5.js, WebGL glitches, shader doodles, and ideas that sometimes work... and sometimes spectacularly fail.
