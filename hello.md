Welcome to my sandbox where I break things for fun and occasionally make something cool. This is where raw code meets creativity â€” a space for wild experiments, generative art, visual algorithms, and other hacky goodness. Expect scribbles in p5.js, WebGL glitches, shader doodles, and ideas that sometimes work...  <br><br>

Check out my sketches ðŸš€ <br><br>

- [Perlin Noise](./sketches/perlin-noise.html): A Perlin Noise Walker <br><br>
- [Hydra Painter](./sketches/hydra-painter.html): p5.js sketch that uses a Hydra brush texture for drawing. Drawing occurs with the Hydra brush texture when the mouse is pressed.  <br><br>
- [Easing Vectors](./sketches/easing-vectors.html): p5.js sketch that defines a Mover class that uses vectors for position, velocity, and acceleration to simulate spring-damped bouncing circles between two vertical limits.  <br><br>
